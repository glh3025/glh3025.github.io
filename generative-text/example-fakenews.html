According to TMZ, one of the men was sitting in his car outside his office after meeting at the bar and was asking about Trump&#39;s $20,000 diamond ring, which the businessman was not getting and was not prepared to give him.</p>
<p>As soon as the men walked into the restaurant they were told to stay put and were told to leave.</p>
<p>Police were called and after questioning they found Mr Trump had been drinking and driving and in possession of illegal marijuana as a result. He was booked into the Santa Monica County Jail and was reportedly booked into the California Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Police allege that the man, dressed in a gray cowboy hat and black sunglasses and holding a large sign-of-intent, gave the man a small amount of cannabis, but declined.</p>

<p>Mr Trump told the sheriff&#39;s department investigators are using the drug to treat his heroin addiction while he faces misdemeanor charges.</p>
<p>But the incident didn&#39;t occur at the store. Mr Trump told the Sheriff&#39;s Department investigators have asked the police department if they can speak to the man they believe was involved to get a comment, but he hasn&#39;t been heard from.</p>
<p>Mr Trump, 48, is also facing multiple drug and weapons charges and a criminal mischief charge this week. He previously was under arrest for the theft of his girlfriend&#39;s SUV, but will instead be arraigned on May 2. If anything, some of the most controversial aspects of the Trump doctrine can be explained away by some very old, very little known doctrine of evolution.</p>
<p>The doctrine of evolution was first articulated at the behest of an American astronomer, who had never observed an organism or known species being born, while still a young child, in a paper from the 1836 edition of the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s journal Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p>It is quite plausible that the view was influenced by an important fact in the science of life â€” that if you get a great deal of life in one form or other the chance of survival increases exponentially. When you try to measure the likelihood of your life being saved from a bad situation or you think that if you had it in your head that you could survive at any temperature, you&#39;ll end up going on to become an expert on that particular topic and thus have something to prove that you have an absolute view of the probability of survival.</p>
